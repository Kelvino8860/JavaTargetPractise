     Create a target practice game that allows the user to click moving targets and displays
     the number of hits in a 10-second period. (In Chapter 4, you learned how to use the
     LocalDateTime class to measure elapsed time.) Create a grid of at least 100 JPanels.
     Randomly display an X on five panels to indicate targets. As the user clicks each X,
     change the label to indicate a hit. When all five Xs have been hit, randomly display a
     new set of five targets. Continue with as many sets as the user can hit in 10 seconds.
     When the time is up, display a count of the number of targets hit. Save the file as
     JTargetPractice.java.
